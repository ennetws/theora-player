# theora-player
Simple, independent cross-platform Theora player using Qt. (video only supported)

No need to download anything else, just type 'qmake' and its all done. Check 'gui_player' for an example player that uses simple QImage.

Based mostly on Theora Video Playback Library by Kresimir Spes.
